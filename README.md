# Welcome to My MySpace

Glitch is what I thought MySpace was doing to our generation. Giving children access to source code. I thought they were going to be so fluent. But maybe, that's just where my mind went. I saw what I wanted MySpace to become. Since MySpace was not that, I tried to articulate that as 4D blogging. At some point I'll port all my 4Dblogging notes over here.

Coding is so incredibly tedious.

This is an online profile that I am building on glitch. Whereas, with all other social networks, you are simply watching people post funny pictures. But here, I am creating content. Part of the reason for this post is because I am simply typing my thoughts on this platform. This place is modern enough to know that all this source code is mine. Very impressive! Not that I need to get these files, but I can back them up and put all this on a repo if I want.

But why go to the trouble of rebuilding a profile when it is Soooooooo EASY to make a profile and share it on [INSERT: advertised sponsored data tracking social network here]?
